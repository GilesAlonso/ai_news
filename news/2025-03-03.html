  <h4>Additional Observations</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">While the Trump-Zelinskyy meeting dominated World and USA discussions, other global events, such as Firefly Aerospace's Moon landing on March 2, 2025, were noted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Wikipedia: 2025</a>, but X posts, like @Firefly_Space's post (<a href="https://x.com/Firefly_Space/status/1896117316326244674" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">https://x.com/Firefly_Space/status/1896117316326244674</a>) with 1,590,663 views, suggested celebration rather than controversy. For Brazil, attempts to find political controversies, such as economic forecasts, yielded no significant X engagement, reinforcing the Rio Carnival as the likely topic. The analysis also considered ongoing issues like Brazilian politics, but without specific events on March 2, 2025, they were less relevant.</p>

The Trump-Zelinskyy meeting was central for World and USA, while the Rio Carnival, with its cultural and safety debates, was prominent for Brazil.
