  <h3>Brazil: Regional Controversial Topics</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">For Brazil, the analysis identified one clear controversial topic on X from March 1, 2025, with potential additional context:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li><strong>Seizure of Eduardo Bolsonaro’s Passport:</strong> This event was highlighted in X posts by <a href="https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1895921005350281406" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">@MarioNawfal</a> and <a href="https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1895933709125402774" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">@MikeBenzCyber</a>, with descriptions of it as a "tyrant regime" action and over 370,000 views combined. The seizure, linked to Eduardo Bolsonaro's political activities, was a significant controversy, reflecting tensions around government authority and political freedom in Brazil.</li>
    <li><strong>Potential Additional Context - Bolsonaro's Charges:</strong> While not directly evidenced by X posts on March 1, 2025, web searches indicated ongoing charges against former President Jair Bolsonaro for attempting to overturn the 2022 election, as reported by sources like Human Rights Watch (<a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/brazil" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">World Report 2025: Brazil</a>). Given its political significance, it may have been a background controversy, though specific X engagement on that day was not found.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-4">The focus on the passport seizure suggests it was the most actively debated controversy on X in Brazil, with high engagement indicating its relevance.</p>
